Some of these modules are directly avaialable from python while others require installation. For this jupyter notebook some modules were already preinstalled, so don't worry about it!. In order to use python module two steps are required. We first need to import module and second reference/call it from the code. In this case we use mathematical module called `numpy` and we will call square root calculation from it `sqrt` e.g."

If we use the above example of square root `sqrt`it took `x = 2`at input and produced `y` which is also the number (1.4142135623730951). However function `plot` may for example produce a plot for given two arguments `x` and `y`. `plot` function takes also 3rd argument 'o' which tells plot function that we want to present it as a dot/point.
